        <h2>We want classrooms with good, fresh air!</h2>
        <p>
            After three years at our school, we have gradually become aware, 
            how important well-ventilated classes are 
            for ideal learning and health conditions. Therefore, the Klimostat 
            2.0 team has set out to develop a system 
            that monitors the air quality of classes  and ensures that 
            the classrooms are regularly ventilated.
